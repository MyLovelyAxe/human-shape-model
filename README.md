# human-shape-model
This is a model with human shape created by .urdf and .xacro files.
Because the lims of human have similar structures such as links(upper arm or lower arm) and joint(arthrosis like elbow and knee), it is eaiser to firstly create model of one lime with .urdf file, and secondly specify the very parts and integrate with .xacro files;
So as to the definitions of controllers.
